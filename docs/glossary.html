<dt id="term-assembly-language">Assembly Language</dt>
<dd>A human readable form of <a class="reference internal" href="#term-machine-language"><span class="xref std std-term">machine language</span></a>. An <a class="reference internal" href="#term-assembler"><span class="xref std std-term">assembler</span></a>
converts code written in this language into <a class="reference internal" href="#term-machine-language"><span class="xref std std-term">machine language</span></a>.
These languages are processor specific.</dd>
<dt id="term-atom">Atom</dt>
<dd>A small fundamental building block making up the matter in the
universe. These atoms are constructed out of even smaller components
called Electrons, Protons, and Neutrons.</dd>
<dt id="term-attribute">Attribute<dt id="term-attributes">Attributes</dt>
<dd>A variable stored inside of a logical structure called an object. In
theory, the object can control access to this variable, protecting it
from being modified maliciously by some other code.</dd>
<dt id="term-base">Base</dt>
<dd>When talking about number systems, the base of that system refers to the number of symbols used.</dd>
<dt id="term-battery">Battery</dt>
<dd>A device that can deliver electrons to a circuit for some period of
time. Some batteries are depleted by this action, others can be
“recharged” so they can function repeatedly.</dd>
<dt id="term-class">Class</dt>
<dd>A “blueprint” for an “object”. The blueprint is used to manufacture
objects at runtime.</dd>
<dt id="term-cloud">Cloud</dt>
<dd>TBD</dd>
<dt id="term-command">Command</dt>
<dd>A series of space-separated text items handed to the operating system.
The first of these items is the name of some program (which may be
internal to the operating system) you want to run. The rest of the
items are called <a class="reference internal" href="#term-parameters"><span class="xref std std-term">parameters</span></a> which are processed by the program
and control exactly what that program does.</dd>
<dt id="term-command-line">Command Line</dt>
<dd>A simple text line on your screen where you can type in a
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-command"><span class="xref std std-term">command</span></a> to the operating system.</dd>
<dt id="term-compiler">Compiler</dt>
<dd>TBD</dd>
<dt id="term-conservation-laws">Conservation Laws</dt>
<dd>Mathematical laws governing interactions going ion in our universe.
Three laws include the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Conservaton</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Mass</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Conservation</span> <span class="pre">of</span>
<span class="pre">Energy</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Conservtion</span> <span class="pre">o</span> <span class="pre">Momentum</span></code>. There are many others in
different fields of study. These laws can be expressed as mathematical
equations, and studied in detail, which makes up much of the work in
science and engineering.</dd>
<dt id="term-current">Current</dt>
<dd>A measure of the movement of electrical potential across some distance</dd>
<dt id="term-current-working-directory">Current Working Directory</dt>
<dd>When working on the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-command-line"><span class="xref std std-term">command line</span></a>, you are placed in some
directory in the file system. The directory you are in at the moment is
called the “current working directory”. You cna change to another
directory with the “CD” command on most systems.</dd>
<dt id="term-directory">Directory<dt id="term-folder">Folder</dt>
<dd>Files, and other directories/folders are collected into a logical group
within a container. That container modes a file folder in an office
filing system. Each such folder can contain files or other folders.</dd>
<dt id="term-encapsulate">Encapsulate</dt>
<dd>To create a protected shell around something. We use such a shell to
prevent outside code from modifying data, or accessing functions that
only the object should access.</dd>
<dt id="term-environment-variable">Environment Variable</dt>
<dd>Each Operating system maintains a list if “variables” that help it
manage various functions. These variables are simply strings of some
sort, and applications can set up variables for their own use. The most
common variable you will use maintains the list of locations where
programs can be found. This variable is normally named just
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-path"><span class="xref std std-term">Path</span></a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-execute">Execute</dt>
<dd>TBD</dd>
<dt id="term-function-prototype">Function Prototype</dt>
<dd>TBD</dd>
<dt id="term-61">Function Prototype</dt>
<dd>TBD</dd>
<dt id="term-gates">gates</dt>
<dd>In digital systems, “gates” are small components designed to perform
simple Boolean operations. Internally, they model a simple <cite>Truth
Table`</cite> defining the operation of the gate. These components need no
clock, they simply transform input signals to output signals.</dd>
<dt id="term-gui">GUI</dt>
<dd>Graphical User Interface. Think “Windows”!</dd>
<dt id="term-19">GUI<dt id="term-graphical-user-interface">Graphical User Interface</dt>
<dd>A Windows based interface, driven largely using a mouse. Invented by
Xerox, and introduced to most of us when we first got our Windows
machine or a Macintosh! (Steve and Bill basically swiped the idea from
Xerox!)</dd>
<dt id="term-hdl">HDL<dt id="term-hardware-description-language">Hardware Description Language</dt>
<dd>A formal language used to describe the operation of a hardware system.
Currently, HDL languages are actively used to design computer systems,
replacing old techniques where circuits were drawn directly.</dd>
<dt id="term-high-level-language">High-Level Language</dt>
<dd>Most programming languages are designed to help humans instruct a
machine in how to solve some problem. These languages do not care what
processor they will run on, and are called <cite>machine independent</cite>.  You
use a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-compiler"><span class="xref std std-term">compiler</span></a> designed to convert your high-level code into
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-machine-language"><span class="xref std std-term">machine language</span></a> for a particular processor. A different
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-compiler"><span class="xref std std-term">compiler</span></a> is needed for each language machine combination.</dd>
<dt id="term-home-directory">Home Directory</dt>
<dd>User accounts on all systems set up a special folder where tat user can
store files. The folder associated with the account is called the “home
directory”.</dd>
<dt id="term-ide">IDE<dt id="term-integrated-development-environment">Integrated Development Environment</dt>
<dd>TBD</dd>
<dt id="term-interrupt">Interrupt<dt id="term-interrupts">Interrupts</dt>
<dd>At the end of each “four-step” cycle in a processor, a signal can be
detected that effectively calls a special function to deal with that
signal. This happens independently of any normal program running at the
time. Interrupts are used to deal with fast response hardware issues.</dd>
<dt id="term-low-level">Low-level</dt>
<dd>TBD</dd>
<dt id="term-machine-language">Machine Language<dt id="term-machine-code">Machine Code</dt>
<dd>The <a class="reference internal" href="#term-low-level"><span class="xref std std-term">low-level</span></a> binary language a particular processor
understands.  <a class="reference internal" href="#term-machine-language"><span class="xref std std-term">Machine Language</span></a> is a set of very simple
instructions that the processor can <a class="reference internal" href="#term-execute"><span class="xref std std-term">execute</span></a>. These languages
are designed by the processor manufacturer, and are unique to that
processor (or processor family). Usually that manufacturer designs an
Assembly Language to go along with their <a class="reference internal" href="#term-machine-language"><span class="xref std std-term">machine language</span></a>, but
you are not required to use that language. As long as your
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-assembler"><span class="xref std std-term">assembler</span></a> generates correct <a class="reference internal" href="#term-machine-language"><span class="xref std std-term">machine language</span></a>, your code
can run on that processor.</dd>
<dt id="term-methods">Methods</dt>
<dd>Functions contained inside of an object are called “methods”. The
method can be asked to perform some action, but that method can
determine exactly what to do. By using this approach, objects can
control their own actions.</dd>
<dt id="term-namespace">Namespace</dt>
<dd>TBD</dd>
<dt id="term-ntp">NTP<dt id="term-network-time-protocol">Network Time Protocol<dt id="term-network-time-synchronization">Network Time Synchronization</dt>
<dd>Servers on the Internet with access to very accurate (usually based on
atomic vibrations) time signals, keep track of the current time and can
report that time to your system using a simple protocol. Most machines
connected to the Internet can be set up to synchronize their view of
the current time with these servers. (The software can even account for
the time it takes for those signals to reach your machine!)</dd>
<dt id="term-object">Object</dt>
<dd>A logical container modeling something from our “human” world. All data
and functions that work on those data should be inside of the
container. This isolates parts of the program, increasing the
reliability of that code.</dd>
<dt id="term-open-source">Open-Source</dt>
<dd>The “Open Source” world is one where all code is freely available and
all source code is available as well. There are a variety of licenses
that control how you can use this software, but basically, as long as
you give credit to the original authors, you can use this code in your
own “open source” projects.</dd>
<dt id="term-over-clock">Over-Clock</dt>
<dd>To run a processor faster than the manufacturer recommends. Some chips
can handle this, since manufacturers are conservative in their ratings.
However, pushing the chip to far will result in internal failures since
components need a minimum amount of time to reach valid levels.</dd>
<dt id="term-parameters">Parameters</dt>
<dd>TBD</dd>
<dt id="term-path">Path</dt>
<dd>The exact location of any file or folder in a file
system is defined by specifying the “path” to that resource. The path
begins with the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-root-directory"><span class="xref std std-term">Root Directory</span></a>, followed by the names of each
subfolder leading to the resource. Between each folder name, we place
the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-path-separator"><span class="xref std std-term">Path Separator</span></a> character.</dd>
<dt id="term-path-separator">Path Separator</dt>
<dd>The character used between names on the system PATH. On a PC, this
separator is a back-slash, on other systems it is a forward-slash.</dd>
<dt id="term-programmer-s-editor">Programmer’s Editor</dt>
<dd>A good editing tool that understands you are writing a computer
program, and helps you do that properly. I use <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> as my personal
editor.</dd>
<dt id="term-real-world">Real World</dt>
<dd>That mystical place where everything is supposed to work properly.
Since in your world things are never working properly, that “real
world” is always just out of reach. But, you really want to live there!</dd>
<dt id="term-recursion">Recursion</dt>
<dd>A programming techniques where you write a function that calls itself
as part of its implementation.</dd>
<dt id="term-reserved-word">Reserved Word</dt>
<dd>Most programming languages include a set of words that are used to help
identify what language feature you are specifying when you write code
in that language. Normally, these special words may not be used for any
other purpose.</dd>
<dt id="term-root-directory">Root Directory</dt>
<dd>File systems are structured as a series of folders and sub-folders. The
top level of this system is called the “root directory”.  The name for
this folder is just the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-path-separator"><span class="xref std std-term">Path Separator</span></a> character, either “/”
or “”.</dd>
<dt id="term-script">Script</dt>
<dd>When you write a short program to help you manage your system, we call
that program a “script”. Popular scripting languages include Python,
and “Bash”.</dd>
<dt id="term-semantics">Semantics</dt>
<dd>In programming, if you follow the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-syntax"><span class="xref std std-term">syntax</span></a> rules correctly, each
construct will be transformed into something the computer can process.
When that processing occurs, some <a class="reference internal" href="#term-state"><span class="xref std std-term">state</span></a> change will occur in
the system. Your understanding of that <a class="reference internal" href="#term-state"><span class="xref std std-term">state</span></a> change is the
“semantics” of the language.</dd>
<dt id="term-shell">Shell<dt id="term-command-prompt">Command Prompt</dt>
<dd>The “old fashioned” way of controlling a computer. On Windows systems,
this involves opening a window where you can type in commands. On Mac
and Linux systems, you open up a <strong class="program">Terminal</strong> program.</dd>
<dt id="term-state">State</dt>
<dd>In programming, we say a system (or the computer while running a
program) is in some “state” at any moment in time. THat state consists
of the contents of every variable in your program at that instant. As
your code “executes” each line causes something to change in the
system. That change is a “state change”. You should clearly understand
what will happen when each line of code you write is processed.</dd>
<dt id="term-syntax">Syntax</dt>
<dd>In programming, the rules that defing the language tell you how to fown constructs in that language. The rules define the “syntax” of the languagg. Failure to follow these rules results in “syntax” errors.</dd>
<dt id="term-test-driven-development">Test Driven Development</dt>
<dd>This is a development technique where you create simple test code that
verifies that a new feature you plan to add to your project actually
works as required. You write this test before creating the feature,
then add code to make that feature work and pass the test. Repeat this
process until you are done.</dd>
<dt id="term-truth-table">truth table</dt>
<dd>A simple table showing the outputs resulting from a fixed set of
inputs. Truth tables are commonly used to show hor Boolean Functions
operate.</dd>
<dt id="term-vm">VM<dt id="term-virtual-machine">Virtual Machine</dt>
<dd>A software implementation of a computer architecture. These programs
can mimic a real computer completely.</dd>
<dt id="term-voltage">Voltage</dt>
<dd>A measure of the difference in electrical potential between two
reference points.</dd>
<dt id="term-52">Voltage</dt>
<dd>TBD</dd>

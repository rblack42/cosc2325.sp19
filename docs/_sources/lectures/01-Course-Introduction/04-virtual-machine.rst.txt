Setting Up a Virtual Machine
############################

..  include::   /header.inc

We will be working in Linux for this class, and since most of you do not have
Linux running on your chosen development system, we are going to use an
important tool in the development world: a :term:`virtual machine`. 

Basically, a :term:`virtual machine` is just a program designed to act like a
real computer. There are several possible such engines available:

    * VMware_ - used in our labs (a commercial product available on all
      platforms)

	* VirtualBox_ - a free tool from Oracle (which we will use here)

	* Parallels_ - a commercial product for Mac

VMware_ seems to be the most advanced engine, but it is complex. There is a
free version of this product, which is what is installed on lab machines. I
prefer to use the VirtualBox_ engine these days. 

To install VirtualBox_ on a PC or Mac, you need to navigate to the product
website and download the correct installer. I am going to demonstrate
installing this tool on my Windows 10 system.

Here is the link I used to get the Windows installer:

    * `VirtualBox-5.2.6-120293-Win.exe
      <https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.2.6/VirtualBox-5.2.6-120293-Win.exe>`_

Launch this program by double-clicking on the program file name in ``Windows
Explorer``:

    :align: center
    :width: 600

Click on "next" to proceed.

..  image:: images/VBinstall2.png
    :align: center
    :width: 600

You can accept the default location for this program. Click "Next" to continue

..  image:: images/VBinstall3.png
    :align: center
    :width: 600

Again, the defaults are fine. Click "Next" to continue.

..  image:: images/VBinstall4.png
    :align: center
    :width: 600

Here, the installer is warning you that you might lose access to the Internet
during the installation. No streaming video should be going on! Click "Next" to
continue.

..  image:: images/VBinstall5.png
    :align: center
    :width: 600

Now, we are ready to install the program. Click "Install" to continue.

..  image:: images/VBinstall6.png
    :align: center
    :width: 600

At this point, the installation will begin. The installer will copy files into
place. You will probably see this pop-up during the process. 

..  image:: images/VBinstall7.png
    :align: center
    :width: 600

Click on "Install" to let drivers be installed.

..  image:: images/VBinstall8.png
    :align: center
    :width: 600

The installation should complete with no problems. Click on "Finish" when this
screen appears.

Installing Linux on Your VM
***************************

Now that you have VirtualBox installed, we need to create a real ``virtual
machine`` running Linux. 

..  warning::

    This is going to take some time, since the file you need to download is
    about 1.8 GB. To save some time, I will place this file on your "I" drive,
    which you can access from a school lab machine.

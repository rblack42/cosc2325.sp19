******************

..  include::   /references.inc

:Due Date: Sunday, Sept 2.

..  note::

    You will complete this assignment by emailing your github_ user name to me
    at rblack@austincc.edu. Be sure to include "HW1" in the subject line to
    receive credit. This is the only assignment you will submit by email!


Prerequisites
=============

Before you can get any work graded for this course, you must set up a personal
account on GitHub_. This is a free service that hosts millions of
:term:`open-source` projects. As a software developer, this is an incredible
resource, one you should explore  often when looking into how to use a new
language, or developer's tool. It is a place to see examples of outstanding
code, and terrible code. Exploring this site can make you a better programmer.

..  warning::

    NEVER submit any code to me that you copied directly from GitHub_ or any
    other source, including other students in this class. . Doing so will
    result in a grade of zero for that assignment. If the infraction occurs
    more than once, you will automatically be issued a grade of zero for the
    course.

Part 1: Create your account
===========================

    1.  Navigate to GitHub_ using your favorite web browser.

    2.  Find the sign-in panel that looks like this:

    3. Enter a unique user name.

..  warning::

    This name is something a potential employer will see when they consider you
    for a job. Do not pick a name that will embarrass you in that situation. You
    may regret that name later. YMMV!

    4.  Enter a suitable email address. I recommend that you use your ACC email
        address.

    5.  Pick a password you can remember.

To complete this assignment, email your user name to me!
